# Graphs and Games

In this assignment, you will implement the Graph ADT and several associated operations. You will then integrate this ADT with the Kamino game, which involves hunting for a missing spaceship and then gathering spice after recovering the spaceship.

# Goals

Your goals for this assignment are to:

- Understand and apply the concept of encapsulation;
- Understand interfaces;
- Understand what graphs are and how they can be represented;
- Implement some basic graph algorithms.

**Preliminary reference: [Wikipedia entry on Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics))** 

You will also use [Java Generics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/why.html) to produce a reusable Graph ADT.
